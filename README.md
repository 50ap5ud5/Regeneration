# Regeneration mod for minecraft

### What does it do?
Inspired by a really unpopular British television show that no one has ever heard of, this mod allows you to obtain the regeneration of powers of a "timelord." Once you obtain the powers, you will regenerate into a new life instead of dying. However, this process will only occur 12 times, after which you will die for real.

###### * not actually in the mod

When the regeneration sequence is over, you will be returned to max health in your "new life." During each life you are given random traits that affect small aspects of your character such as strength, speed, jump height, or max health.

Currently the mod is in a beta phase, and in the end is just a little project for me to work on while bored with other things, so it's not feature complete.  

### Planned features
- Better animations
- A better way to see your current traits
- A wider variety of traits
- A better way to get another/reset your regeneration cycle
- Possibly other small aspects of being a timelord

### FAQ
**Q: How do I become a timelord?**
A: Find a "Chameleon Arch" as dungeon loot, and use it while you don't have a superpower, or if you're feeling cheaty, use /superpower <playername> g-regen:timelord

**Q: What do all the traits do/what traits do I have?**
A: By clicking the + sign in your inventory and navigating to abilities, you can see all the available traits and read their descriptions. The traits that do not have a padlock symbol next to them are your current life's traits.

**Q: It doesn't work!**
A: Ensure that you're using the latest 1.12.2 forge, and the latest 1.12 Lucraft Core.

**Q: Why is the transformation animation too fast/not entirely accurate?**
A: I haven't actually seen much of the show, so all I had to go off was one picture of him exploding. My bad, I may fix it later.

**Q: How do I get another regeneration cycle/more regenerations?**
A: A slightly more accurate way is coming soon, but currently if you use another Chameleon Arch while you're already a timelord you can reset your regeneration cycle.
