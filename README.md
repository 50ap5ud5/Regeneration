# Minecraft Regeneration mod

### What does it do?
Inspired by a totally-not-at-all popular British television show, this mod allows you to obtain the regeneration of powers of a 'Timelord'. Once you obtain these powers, you will regenerate into a new body instead of dying. However, this process will only occur 12 times, after which you will die for real.

### How do I obtain these "powers"?
You currently receive your regeneration powers by using a 'Fob Watch', found as dungeon loot. Using a Fob Watch will give you 12 regenerations, with a maximum of 12 regenerations inside a power at a time (leftover regenerations will stay in the watch).

It is possible to craft an empty Fob Watch for storing your precious regenerations using the following recipe:

To store your regenerations in the watch you use the watch in combination with the Shift key. This will transfer 1 regeneration from your body into the watch. This is very useful for when you're going to do something stupid and don't want to waste your precious regenerations.

### 'Grace period'
Sometimes a regeneration just comes at the worst possible moment. You obviously don't want your house to burn down, or maybe you're in a very dangerous situation and can't afford to be vulnerable right now. Luckily this mod allows you to enter a so-called 'grace period'. When you die, your death will be held off and you'll be given the choice: enter a grace period, or regenerate right now.
If you choose to enter the grace period, you can delay your regeneration for up to 15 minutes. Waiting too long will result in a loss of regenerations and a wasteful death. You can also activate immediate regeneration by pressing the 'R' key.
Once you've entered the grace period, your walking speed will be heavily limited, and your hand will glow once a minute to warn you that a regeneration is coming. Punching any block will delay your regeneration for longer, as long as you stay within the 15 minute limit.

### The actual regeneration
The process of regeneration itself is quite simple. You'll explode in a violent burt of light and tnt-like explosions. Everything within a range of 3 blocks will be killed immediately (this can be changed in the configuration file), and everything in a range of 7 blocks will be knocked back (this too can be changed). Once you finish your regeneration you will receive a full health and hunger bar, and maximum oxygen if you're underwater. (All of this can be changed in the configuration file.)
