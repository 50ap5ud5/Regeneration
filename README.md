# Minecraft Regeneration mod

### What does it do?
Inspired by a totally-not-at-all popular British television show, this mod allows you to obtain the regeneration of powers of a 'Timelord'. Once you obtain these powers, you will regenerate into a new body instead of dying. However, this process will only occur 12 times, after which you will die for real.

### How do I obtain these "powers"?
You currently receive your regeneration powers by using a 'Fob Watch', found as dungeon loot. Using a Fob Watch will give you 12 regenerations, with a maximum of 12 regenerations inside a power at a time (leftover regenerations will stay in the watch).
To store your regenerations in the watch you can use the watch in combination with the Shift key. This will transfer 1 regeneration from your body into the watch. An example of why this is useful is when you are going on a dangerous mission, and you don't want to waste your regenerations.

### 'Grace period'
Sometimes a regeneration just comes at the worst possible moment. You obviously don't want your house to burn down, or maybe you're in a very dangerous situation and can't afford to be vulnerable right now. Luckily this mod allows you to enter a so-called 'grace period'. When you die, your death will be held off and you'll be given the choice: enter a grace period, or regenerate right now.
If you choose to enter the grace period, you can delay your regeneration for up to 15 minutes. Waiting too long will result in a loss of regenerations and a wasteful death.
Once you've entered the grace period, your walking speed will be heavily limited, and your hand will glow once a minute to warn you that a regeneration is coming. Punching any block will delay your regeneration for longer, as long as you stay within the 15 minute limit.

### The actual regeneration
The process of regeneration itself is quite simple. You'll explode in a violent burt of light and tnt-like explosions. Everything within a range of 3 blocks will be killed immediately (this can be changed in the configuration file), and everything in a range of 5 blocks will be knocked back (this too can be changed). Once you finish your regeneration you will receive a full health and hunger bar, and maximum oxygen if you're underwater. (All of this can be changed in the configuration file.)
